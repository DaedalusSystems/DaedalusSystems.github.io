          Daedalus Systems prices projects based on the real complexity of your workflows,
          not vague “seats” or usage tiers. Start with a focused workflow or build a full
          digital front desk—without committing to anything that doesn’t fit your business.

      <!-- Custom Build -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Custom Build</h2>
        <p>
          For more complex operations or non-real-estate businesses, we scope a custom
          project around your exact tools, data, and requirements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Workflow mapping across multiple systems and teams, if needed.</li>
          <li>Automations designed to fit your existing stack, not replace it.</li>
          <li>Room for specialized logic, approvals, or reporting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re not sure where you fit, we can use a short call to map your
          processes and recommend the right level of build.
        </p>

          will have the biggest impact, and give you a clear project quote before
          you commit to anything.
